# About

RembrandtSwift is an image comparison library for swift 3 with objective-C bindings, based on Rembrandt**JS** see http://rembrandtjs.com. We created Rembrandt to have an easy-to-use image comparison library for our internal tests for [PhotoEditor SDK](www.photoeditorsdk.com/?utm_campaign=Projects&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Side_Projects&utm_content=Rembrandt&utm_term=iOS). 

## Installation
### CocoaPods
Here's what you have to add to your Podfile:

```
use_frameworks!

target '<your product here>' do
  pod 'rembrandt', :path => '../'
end

```
## Usage
```swift
let imageA = UIImage(named: "imageA")
let imageB = UIImage(named: "imageB")
let rembrandt = Rembrandt()
let result = rembrandt.compare(imageA: imageA!, imageB: imageB!)
```
